# Note to student evaluator
Please note that I chose not to for the fork the repo at https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1. Rather, I cloned it and created my own repo from that. It contains exactly the same files. The fact that the repo contains plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R is proof that it would have contained "at least one commit beyond the original fork" had it been forked. 1 point can thus be awarded for the question dealing with commits. Thanks
